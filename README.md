# "How to..." for getting into graduate school
This repository is intended for 2 audiences: (1) Undergraduates that are interested in attending graduate school and (2) Professors that are interested in helping their students understand the transition from undergrad to grad school

This repository is also targetted towards the Biological sciences. The process for graduate school entry for other STEM fields may be very or slightly different.

In the end there will be 3 presentations:

(1) When and how to apply for graduate school

(2) What is the difference between the personal statement and statement of purpose?

(3) How to prepare for the interview
