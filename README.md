# "How to..." for getting into graduate school
This repository is intended for 2 audiences: (1) Undergraduates that are interested in attending graduate school and (2) Professors that are interested in helping their students understand the transition from undergrad to grad school

This repository is also targetted towards the Biological sciences. The process for graduate school entry for other STEM fields may be very or slightly different.
